Hello World
My name is Amani-Kyle Thomas, and I attended Martin Van Buren High School. 
I tend to be very introverted, preferring to stay quiet and keep to myself. 
I'm not involved in many hobbies, but I do spend a lot of time playing video games. 
Alongside gaming, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows.
