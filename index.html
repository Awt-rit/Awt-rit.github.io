Hello World
<html>
<body>
<p>Hello, my name is Amani-Kyle Thomas, and I attended Martin Van Buren High School.</p> 
<p>I tend to be very introverted, preferring to stay quiet and keep to myself.</p> 
<p>I'm not involved in many hobbies, but I do spend a lot of time playing video games.</p> 
<p>Alongside gaming, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows.</p>
